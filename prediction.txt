Autoencoders are deep learning models used for unsupervised learning, consisting of input, encoder, bottleneck hidden, decoder, and output layers. The encoder compresses input data into a compact summary, the bottleneck hidden layer contains important features, and the decoder reconstructs the data. Practical uses include text summarization and generation in algorithms like Transformers and Big Bird, image compression, and a nonlinear version of PCA. Other parameters that can be adjusted include dropout rate, kernel, activation function, and number of epochs for training.

An activation function is a mathematical function used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity and decide whether neurons should be activated or not. It transforms the weighted sum of inputs into outputs, such as the sigmoid function (f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))) for classification, ReLU (f(x) = max(0,x)) for non-negative outputs, and tanh or softmax for other applications. The choice of activation function depends on the specific task and requirements. The gradient vanishing problem can occur with sigmoid, and computationally expensive functions like exp should be avoided. Non-linearity is essential to capture complex features and variations that simple linear models cannot capture.

1. Helps in training deeper neural networks. 2. Improves covariate shift proof NN architecture. 3. Provides a slight regularization effect. 4. Results in centered and controlled values of activation. 5. Tries to prevent exploding/vanishing gradient. 6. Can lead to faster training and convergence to the minimum loss function. Note: Batch Normalization standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch during training, which helps in addressing issues like vanishing gradient and exploding gradient while backpropagating. It also improves the training of deeper neural networks, provides better covariate shift proof NN architecture, results in centered and controlled values of activation, and provides a slight regularization effect. It can also lead to faster training and convergence to the minimum loss function.

1. Poor loss on training data 2. Unstable model with large changes in loss 3. Model loss goes to NaN during training 4. Weights quickly become very large during training 5. Model weights go to NaN values during training 6. Error gradient values consistently above 1.0 for each node and layer during training Note: The first three signs are subtle, while the last three signs are less subtle and confirm the presence of exploding gradients. Other causes of poor performance, such as under-fitting, large learning rates, improper initialization, and excessive regularization, should also be considered.

1. Number of nodes: determines the size of each layer in a neural network. 2. Batch normalization: normalizes inputs in a layer to improve training stability and accelerate convergence. 3. Learning rate: controls the step size for updating weights and biases during training. 4. Dropout rate: temporarily drops a percentage of nodes during the forward pass to prevent overfitting. 5. Kernel: matrix used for dot product in convolutional layers. 6. Activation function: transforms the weighted sum of inputs into outputs. 7. Number of epochs: number of passes through the training data. 8. Softmax: used at the last layer for classification problems to return a set of probabilities with a sum of 1. 9. Optimizers: used to fine-tune the learning rate and momentum to find the optimal weights and biases. 10. Learning rate: crucial for well-trained models as it determines how much to update weights and biases after training on each batch.

Parameter sharing in deep learning refers to the method of using the same weights for multiple neurons in a feature map, reducing the number of parameters and making the system computationally cheaper. This allows for diverse feature representations learned by the system, as neurons corresponding to the same features are triggered in varied scenarios. However, in cases where input images have specific centered structures, such as faces, it may not make sense to assume parameter sharing, and locally-connected layers may be used instead. Hyperparameters, such as the number of nodes, batch normalization, learning rate, and dropout rate, affect the model's performance but are manually set by the user.

1. A typical CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, each followed by a ReLU or activation function and a pooling layer. 2. Feature maps are generated by a single kernel filter in each convolutional layer, which are used as input for the next layer. 3. The number of filters increases as the image size decreases through the convolutional and pooling layers. Other parameters such as dropout rate, kernel size, activation function, and number of epochs are also important in CNN architecture. After flattening the final small image with many filters, fully connected layers or a softmax layer is used for classification.

The Vanishing Gradient Problem in Artificial Neural Networks occurs when gradients become too small during training, making it difficult for the weights to update. This can happen in networks with many hidden layers due to the multiplication of derivatives in earlier layers. To fix this, techniques like Leaky ReLU, LSTM cells, and Batch Normalization can be used to prevent the gradients from vanishing. Additionally, proper initialization, learning rate scheduling, and regularization can help mitigate the issue. However, it's also important to avoid exploding gradients, which can occur when updates to weights become excessively large, leading to instability.
