Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning). They are trained to transform the input data into a low-dimensional representation that is useful for downstream tasks.

1. Nonlinear activation function: When the activation function is non-linear, then a two-layer neural network can be proven to be a universal function approximator. This is known as the Universal Approximation Theorem. The identity activation function does not satisfy this property. When multiple layers use the identity activation function, the entire network is equivalent to a single-layer model. 2. Range: When the range of the activation function is finite, gradient-based training methods tend to be more stable, because pattern presentations significantly affect only limited weights. When the range is infinite, training is generally more efficient because pattern presentations significantly affect most of the weights. 3. Continuously differentiable: This property is desirable (ReLU is not continuously differentiable and has some issues with gradient-based optimization, but it is still possible) for enabling gradient-based optimization methods. The binary step activation function is not differentiable at 0, and it differentiates to 0 for all other values, so gradient-based methods can make no progress with it. 4. Three types of activation functions: 1. Binary step activation function: This activation function is not differentiable at 0, and it differentiates


1. Reduces internal covariate shift: Batch Normalization is proposed to reduce internal covariate shift, which is a problem for deep networks, because small changes in shallower hidden layers will be amplified as they propagate within the network, resulting in significant shift in deeper hidden layers. 2. Improves generalization properties: With this additional operation, the network can use higher learning rate without vanishing or exploding gradients. 3. Increases robustness to different initialization schemes and learning rates: It has been observed that the network becomes more robust to different initialization schemes and learning rates while using batch normalization. 4. Dependent on mini-batches: During the training stage, the normalization steps depend on the mini-batches to ensure efficient and reliable training. However, in the inference stage, this dependence is not useful any more. Instead, the normalization step in this stage is computed with the population statistics such that the output could depend on the input in a deterministic manner. 5. Complete representation of mini-batches: The population statistics thus is a complete representation of the mini-batches. 6. Batch Normalization transform in the inference step: The

1. Learning rate: The learning rate determines how fast the algorithm updates the weights of the network. A higher learning rate means that the algorithm will learn faster, but it may also overfit the data. A lower learning rate means that the algorithm will learn more slowly, but it may not overfit the data. 2. Batch size: The batch size determines how many examples the algorithm can process at once. A larger batch size means that the algorithm can process more examples, but it may also take longer to train. A smaller batch size means that the algorithm can process fewer examples, but it may also take less time to train. 3. Momentum: Momentum is a type of stochastic gradient descent that helps to reduce the variance of the gradients. It is a parameter that controls the amount of momentum. A smaller momentum value means that the algorithm will learn faster, but it may also overfit the data. A larger momentum value means that the algorithm will learn more slowly, but it may not overfit the data. 4. L2 regularization: L2 regularization is a type of regularization that penalizes the weights of the network by adding a term to the loss function that is proportional to


Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn complex patterns from data. One of the key concepts in deep learning is parameter sharing, which is used to reduce the number of parameters required for a neural network. Parameter sharing is achieved by sharing the same weights and biases across different layers of the network. This reduces the memory footprint and allows for more efficient computation. In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), parameter sharing is used to control the number of free parameters. The neurons in each depth slice share the same parameters, which reduces the number of parameters required for the network. This allows for more efficient computation and reduces the risk of overfitting.


A typical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a feed-forward neural network that consists of multiple layers of convolutional kernels (also known as filters) that are applied to the input data. The input data is first passed through a convolutional layer, which performs a set of convolutions on the input data to generate a feature map. The feature map is then passed through a pooling layer, which reduces the size of the feature map by downsampling it. The feature map is then passed through another convolutional layer, which performs another set of convolutions on the feature map to generate a new feature map. This process is repeated until the feature map becomes a feature map with a fixed size. The feature map is then passed through a fully connected layer, which is followed by a non-linear activation function (such as ReLU) to produce a final output. The architecture of a typical CNN is shown in the figure below. The input to the CNN is a tensor with shape (number of inputs) × (input height) × (input width) × (input channels). The output of the CNN is a feature map with shape (number of inputs) × (feature map height) × (feature map


1. Vanishing Gradients: Vanishing Gradients is a phenomenon where the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the neural network vanishes, leading to poor performance. This can occur due to the following reasons: 1. Non-differentiable activation functions: Non-differentiable activation functions can lead to vanishing gradients. For example, ReLU activation function has a non-differentiable derivative, which makes it difficult to differentiate the loss function. 2. Non-smooth loss functions: Non-smooth loss functions can lead to vanishing gradients. For example, the cross-entropy loss function is non-smooth and can lead to vanishing gradients. 3. Non-differentiable layers: Non-differentiable layers can lead to vanishing gradients. For example, convolutional layers in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are non-differentiable and can lead to vanishing gradients. 4. Non-differentiable weights: Non-differentiable weights can lead to vanishing gradients. For
